# Station Manager: subsys

This module contains a subsystem and provides a simple interface to common functions required by two or more higher
facades. Think of this as a basic API for functions common across some or all of the Station Manager
applications. Mostly, (but not exclusively) these functions involve validation and database CRUD methods that are used
by the frontend applications. The functions provided here are those that would be duplicated across some or all of the
applications. These functions are designed to be easily reusable and maintainable, and are intended to simplify the
development process for the Station Manager applications.
